        <p class="text">Happy birthday, ssob. I learned a lot from you in a short period of time, but what really struck me was that you helped me understand death in a new light and convinced me that it's not all that horrible. I think it's because of you that I'm less terrified of dying and I could even welcome it when the time comes.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text"> You are a significant person to me, Genesis. I wish that you can embrace the future that lies ahead of you, whether it be good or bad, in the same way that you have welcomed death.</p>
